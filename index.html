          <p><strong>Brief Histroy of Momofuko Ando</strong></p>
        </center>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>He was born on Saturday 5 March 1910 in Hoklo Taiwan. He was raised by his grandparents following
            the timely passing
    
            of his parents. They owned a textile shop and educated him in all aspects of the business.</li>
    
          <li>Ando went to Ritsumeikan University in Japan to study economics in 1933. Whilst there he also set up
            a textile
            company.</li>
    
          <li>In 1948 Ando was convicted for tax fraud and served two years in jail. As a result, his textile
            company declared
            bankrupt and was closed.</li>
    
          <li>Following the end of the Second World War, Japan had a country wide food shortage. Ando wanted to
            aid in resolving
            the
    
            problem. On August 25 1958, after months of trial-and-error experimentation, Ando released his
            precooked instant
    
            noodles. They were based on a flash-frying method which enabled them to be cooked with just hot
            water.</li>
    
          <li>On release of the first instant noodle, they were considered a luxury item due to launch price being
            multiple times
            that
    
            of udon or soba noodles, the traditional available products at the time. This would later fall
            dramatically in price
            as the process was refined.</li>
    
          <li>On September 4 1958, Nissin Foods was founded.</li>
    
          <li>Building on his invention, Ando created the Cup noodle in 1971. This created the worldwide
            popularity of instant
            noodles.</li>
    
          <li>In 1977 Ando was awarded the Medal of Honor with a Blue Ribbon for his services to the poor and
            war-torn people of
            Japan.</li>
    
          <li>in 1982 Ando received the Order of the Sacred Treasure, Second Class with Gold and Silver Stars.
          </li>
    
          <li>In 1983 Ando received the Medal of Honor with a Purple Ribbon.</li>
    
          <li>In 1983 Ando established the Ando Foundation to educate young people on the benefits of healthy
            eating and an active
            lifestyle.</li>
    
          <li>Ando was made the Director of Science and Technology in Japan in 1992.</li>
    
          <li>In 1999, the Cup Noodles Museum was opened, which included a dedication to the man who invented
            them.</li>
    
          <li>The Japanese government awarded the Order of the Rising sun, Second Class, with Gold and Silver
            Stars in 2002.</li>
    
          <li>In 2005 at the age of 94, Ando completed a long-held dream to create ramen that can be eaten in
            space. In July of
            that year the dream was completed when a Japanese astronaut took the Space Ramen on a mission. The
            ramen would later
            be taken on a mission to the International Space Station in 2009.</li>
    
          <li>On January 5 2007, at the age of 96, Momofuku Ando passed away.</li>
